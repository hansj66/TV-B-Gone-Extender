TV-B-Gone-Extender
==================

This booster uses an optical link, and requires no modification of the TV-B-Gone itself. Just insert the TV-B-Gone into the booster. The booster reads the output from the TV-B-Gone using an LTR3208E phototransistor and switches the same signal to 19 TSAL7200 60mW IR diodes, using a simple TIP122 transistor. The end result is that you boost the output power from the TV-B-Gone to 1140 mW (external 9-12V battery pack required).

For added awesomeness, I have created a 3D-printed 50s ray gun enclosure to hold the booster and TV-B-Gone :)

Bill of materials: 

19 x TSAL7200 IR diodes 

19 x 33 ohm resistors 

1 x LTR3208E IR phototransistor (make sure it points directly towards the emitter on the TV-B-Gone 

1 x 1kohm resistor 

1 x TIP122 transistor


All of the components can be swapped with equivalent versions, but you have to make sure the emitter and receiver operate on the correct wavelength (940 nm)
